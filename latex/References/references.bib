abstract = {JASPAR (http://jaspar.genereg.net) is an open-access database storing curated, non-redundant transcription factor (TF) binding profiles representing transcription factor binding preferences as position frequency matrices for multiple species in six taxonomic groups. For this 2016 release, we expanded the JASPAR CORE collection with 494 new TF binding profiles (315 in vertebrates, 11 in nematodes, 3 in insects, 1 in fungi and 164 in plants) and updated 59 profiles (58 in vertebrates and 1 in fungi). The introduced profiles represent an 83{\%} expansion and 10{\%} update when compared to the previous release. We updated the structural annotation of the TF DNA binding domains (DBDs) following a published hierarchical structural classification. In addition, we introduced 130 transcription factor flexible models trained on ChIP-seq data for vertebrates, which capture dinucleotide dependencies within TF binding sites. This new JASPAR release is accompanied by a new web tool to infer JASPAR TF binding profiles recognized by a given TF protein sequence. Moreover, we provide the users with a Ruby module complementing the JASPAR API to ease programmatic access and use of the JASPAR collection of profiles. Finally, we provide the JASPAR2016 R/Bioconductor data package with the data of this release.},

abstract = {Objective DNA methylation may be a stable epigenetic contributor to defining fat cell lineage. Methods We performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and RNA-seq to depict a genome-wide integrative view of the DNA methylome and transcriptome during brown and white adipogenesis. Results Our analysis demonstrated that DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic signature for brown and white cell lineage before, during, and after differentiation. We identified 31 genes whose promoters were significantly differentially methylated between white and brown adipogenesis at all three time points of differentiation. Among them, five genes belong to the Hox family; their expression levels were anti-correlated with promoter methylation, suggesting a regulatory role of DNA methylation in transcription. Blocking DNA methylation with 5-Aza-cytidine increased the expression of these genes, with the most prominent effect on Hoxc10, a repressor of BAT marker expression. Conclusions Our data suggest that DNA methylation may play an important role in lineage-specific development in adipocytes.},

abstract = {The maternal and paternal copies of the genome are both required for mammalian development and this is primarily due to imprinted genes, those that are mono-allelically expressed based on parent-of-origin. Typically, this pattern of expression is regulated by differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that are established in the germline and maintained after fertilisation. There are a large number of germline DMRs that have not yet been associated with imprinting and their function in development is unknown. In this study, we developed a genome-wide approach to identify novel imprinted DMRs in the human placenta, and investigated the dynamics of these imprinted DMRs during development in somatic and extra-embryonic tissues. DNA methylation was evaluated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array in 134 human tissue samples, publically available reduced representation bisulfite sequencing in the human embryo and germ cells, and targeted bisulfite sequencing in term placentas. 43 known and 101 novel imprinted DMRs were identified in the human placenta, by comparing methylation between diandric and digynic triploid conceptions in addition to female and male gametes. 72 novel DMRs showed a pattern consistent with placental-specific imprinting and this mono-allelic methylation was entirely maternal in origin. Strikingly, these DMRs exhibited polymorphic imprinted methylation between placental samples. These data suggest that imprinting in human development is far more extensive and dynamic than previously reported and that the placenta preferentially maintains maternal germline-derived DNA methylation.},

While genetic risk of disease is currently unmodifiable, there is hope that epigenetic risk may be reversible and or modifiable. This review will take a look back at the origins of this field and revisit the past early efforts to conduct EWAS using the 27k Illumina methylation beadarrays, to the present where most investigators are using the 450k Illumina beadarrays and finally to the future where next generation sequencing based methods beckon. There have been numerous diseases, exposures and lifestyle factors investigated with EWAS, with several significant associations now identified. However, much like the GWAS studies, EWAS are likely to require large international consortium-based approaches to reach the numbers of subjects, and statistical and scientific rigor, required for robust findings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent assays for individual-specific genome-wide DNA methylation profiles have enabled epigenome-wide association studies to identify specific CpG sites associated with a phenotype. Computational prediction of CpG site-specific methylation levels is critical to enable genome-wide analyses, but current approaches tackle average methylation within a locus and are often limited to specific genomic regions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We characterize genome-wide DNA methylation patterns, and show that correlation among CpG sites decays rapidly, making predictions solely based on neighboring sites challenging. We built a random forest classifier to predict methylation levels at CpG site resolution using features including neighboring CpG site methylation levels and genomic distance, co-localization with coding regions, CpG islands (CGIs), and regulatory elements from the ENCODE project. Our approach achieves 92{\%} prediction accuracy of genome-wide methylation levels at single-CpG-site precision. The accuracy increases to 98{\%} when restricted to CpG sites within CGIs and is robust across platform and cell-type heterogeneity. Our classifier outperforms other types of classifiers and identifies features that contribute to prediction accuracy: neighboring CpG site methylation, CGIs, co-localized DNase I hypersensitive sites, transcription factor binding sites, and histone modifications were found to be most predictive of methylation levels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our observations of DNA methylation patterns led us to develop a classifier to predict DNA methylation levels at CpG site resolution with high accuracy. Furthermore, our method identified genomic features that interact with DNA methylation, suggesting mechanisms involved in DNA methylation modification and regulation, and linking diverse epigenetic processes.},

This assay, termed HELP (HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR), allows both intragenomic profiling and intergenomic comparisons of cytosine methylation. The intragenomic profile shows most of the genome to be contiguous methylated sequence with occasional clusters of hypomethylated loci, usually but not exclusively at promoters and CpG islands. Intergenomic comparison found marked differences in cytosine methylation between spermatogenic and brain cells, identifying 223 new candidate tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (T-DMRs). Bisulfite pyrosequencing confirmed the four candidates tested to be T-DMRs, while quantitative RT-PCR for two genes with T-DMRs located at their promoters showed the HELP data to be correlated with gene activity at these loci. The HELP assay is robust, quantitative, and accurate and is providing new insights into the distribution and dynamic nature of cytosine methylation in the genome.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The Illumina Infinium 450k DNA Methylation Beadchip is a prime candidate technology for Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that probes come in two different designs, characterised by widely different DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs. RESULTS: Here we propose a novel model-based intra-array normalisation strategy for 450k data, called BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation), to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a statistical distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves application of a 3-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin embedded tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favourably to two competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ improves the robustness of the normalisation procedure, reduces the technical variation and bias of type2 probe values, and successfully eliminates the type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type2 probes. BMIQ will be useful as a preprocessing step for any study using the Illumina Infinium 450k platform. AVAILABILITY: BMIQ is freely available from code.google.com/p/bmiq/.

abstract = {Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have dramatically revolutionised research in many fields of genetics. The ability to sequence many individuals from one or multiple populations at a genomic scale has greatly enhanced population genetics studies and made it a data-driven discipline. Recently, researchers have proposed statistical modelling to address genotyping uncertainty associated with NGS data. However, an ongoing debate is whether it is more beneficial to increase the number of sequenced individuals or the per-sample sequencing depth for estimating genetic variation. Through extensive simulations, I assessed the accuracy of estimating nucleotide diversity, detecting polymorphic sites, and predicting population structure under different experimental scenarios. Results show that the greatest accuracy for estimating population genetics parameters is achieved by employing a large sample size, despite single individuals being sequenced at low depth. Under some circumstances, the minimum sequencing depth for obtaining accurate estimates of allele frequencies and to identify polymorphic sites is , where both alleles are more likely to have been sequenced. On the other hand, inferences of population structure are more accurate at very large sample sizes, even with extremely low sequencing depth. This all points to the conclusion that under various experimental scenarios, in cost-limited population genetics studies, large sample sizes at low sequencing depth are desirable to achieve high accuracy. These findings will help researchers design their experimental set-ups and guide further investigation on the effect of protocol design for genetic research.},

DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark occurring in C-phosphate-G sites (CpGs) that leads to local or regional gene expression changes. Reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is a technique that is used to ascertain the DNA methylation of millions of CpGs at single-nucleotide resolution. The genomic coverage of RRBS is given by the restriction enzyme combination used during the library preparation and the throughput capacity of the next-generation sequencer, which is used to read the generated libraries. The four-nucleotide cutters, MspI and Taq$\alpha$I, are restriction enzymes commonly used in RRBS that, when combined, achieve {\~{}}12{\%} genomic coverage. The increase in throughput of next-generation sequencers allows for novel combinations of restriction enzymes that provide higher CpG coverage.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We performed a near-neighbor analysis of the four nucleotide sequences most frequently found within 50 nt of all genomic CpGs.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was developed to measure DNA methylation of high-CG regions at single base-pair resolution, and has been widely used because of its minimal DNA requirements and cost efficacy; however, the CpG coverage of genomic regions is restricted and important regions with low-CG will be ignored in DNA methylation profiling. This method could be improved to generate a more comprehensive representation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Based on in silico simulation of enzyme digestion of human and mouse genomes, we have optimized the current single-enzyme RRBS by applying double enzyme digestion in the library construction to interrogate more representative regions. CpG coverage of genomic regions was considerably increased in both high-CG and low-CG regions using the double-enzyme RRBS method, leading to more accurate detection of their average methylation levels and identification of differential methylation regions between samples. We also applied this double-enzyme RRBS method to comprehensively analyze the CpG methylation profiles of two colorectal cancer cell lines.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The double-enzyme RRBS increases the CpG coverage of genomic regions considerably over the previous single-enzyme RRBS method, leading to more accurate detection of their average methylation levels. It will facilitate genome-wide DNA methylation studies in multiple and complex clinical samples.},

abstract = {Microarray technology has become a standard molecular biology tool. Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140 000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of microarray data will increase the efficiency with which biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published genomic data.Availability: GEOquery is available as part of the BioConductor project.Contact:sdavis2@mail.nih.gov},

Our approach capitalizes on a new use for the Infinium I design bead types to measure non-specific fluorescence in the colour channel opposite of their design (Cy3/Cy5). This provides tens of thousands of features for measuring background instead of the much smaller number of negative control probes on the platforms (n = 32 for HumanMethylation27 and n = 614 for HumanMethylation450, respectively). We compare the performance of our methods with existing approaches, using technical replicates of both mixture samples and biological samples, and demonstrate that within- and between-platform artefacts can be substantially reduced, with concomitant improvement in sensitivity, by the proposed methods.},

abstract = {Motivation: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++.

abstract = {DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in regulating gene expression and therefore a broad range of biological processes and diseases. DNA methylation is tissue-specific, dynamic, sequence-context-dependent and trans-generationally heritable, and these complex patterns of methylation highlight the significance of profiling DNA methylation to answer biological questions. In this review, we surveyed major methylation assays, along with comparisons and biological examples, to provide an overview of DNA methylation profiling techniques. The advances in microarray and sequencing technologies make genome-wide profiling possible at a single-nucleotide or even a single-cell resolution. These profiling approaches vary in many aspects, such as DNA input, resolution, genomic region coverage, and bioinformatics analysis, and selecting a feasible method requires knowledge of these methods. We first introduce the biological background of DNA methylation and its pattern in plants, animals and fungi. We present an overview of major experimental approaches to profiling genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation and then extend to the single-cell methylome. To evaluate these methods, we outline their strengths and weaknesses and perform comparisons across the different platforms. Due to the increasing need to compute high-throughput epigenomic data, we interrogate the computational pipeline for bisulfite sequencing data and also discuss the concept of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs). This review summarizes the experimental and computational concepts for profiling genome-wide DNA methylation, followed by biological examples. Overall, this review provides researchers useful guidance for the selection of a profiling method suited to specific research questions.},

Epigenetic studies have been seldom conducted in the extremely diverse and evolutionarily highly successful bilaterian lineage Mollusca. In the present study, we conducted the genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation for five tissues of a bivalve mollusc, Chlamys farreri using the methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) technique. The methylation levels were quite similar among tissues, ranging from 20.9{\%} to 21.7{\%}. CG methylation was the dominant type (14.9{\%}–16.5{\%}) in the C. farreri genome, but CHG methylation also accounted for a substantial fraction of total methylation (5.1{\%}–6.3{\%}). Relatively high methylation diversity was observed within tissues. Methylation differentiation between tissues was evaluated and 460 tissue-specific epiloci were identified. Kidney differs from the other tissues in DNA methylation profiles. Our study presents the first look at the tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns in a bivalve mollusc and represents an initial step towards understanding of epigenetic regulatory mechanism underlying tissue development and differentiation in bivalves.},

abstract = {Human DNA-methylation data have been used to develop highly accurate biomarkers of aging ("epigenetic clocks"). Recent studies demonstrate that similar epigenetic clocks for mice (Mus Musculus) can be slowed by gold standard anti-aging interventions such as calorie restriction and growth hormone receptor knock-outs. Using DNA methylation data from previous publications with data collected in house for a total 1189 samples spanning 193,651 CpG sites, we developed 4 novel epigenetic clocks by choosing different regression models (elastic net- versus ridge regression) and by considering different sets of CpGs (all CpGs vs highly conserved CpGs). We demonstrate that accurate age estimators can be built on the basis of highly conserved CpGs. However, the most accurate clock results from applying elastic net regression to all CpGs. While the anti-aging effect of calorie restriction could be detected with all types of epigenetic clocks, only ridge regression based clocks replicated the finding of slow epigenetic aging effects in dwarf mice. Overall, this study demonstrates that there are trade-offs when it comes to epigenetic clocks in mice. Highly accurate clocks might not be optimal for detecting the beneficial effects of anti-aging interventions.},

While many different techniques for genome-scale mapping of DNA methylation have been employed, throughput has been a key limitation for most.

BglII restriction fragments were size-selected to 500-600 bp, equipped with adapters, treated with bisulfite, PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced. We constructed RRBS libraries from murine ES cells and from ES cells lacking DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and 3b and with knocked-down (kd) levels of Dnmt1 (Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-]). Sequencing of 960 RRBS clones from Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells generated 343 kb of non-redundant bisulfite sequence covering 66212 cytosines in the genome. All but 38 cytosines had been converted to uracil indicating a conversion rate of {\textgreater}99.9{\%}. Of the remaining cytosines 35 were found in CpG and 3 in CpT dinucleotides. Non-CpG methylation was {\textgreater}250-fold reduced compared with wild-type ES cells, consistent with a role for Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b in CpA and CpT methylation. Closer inspection revealed neither a consensus sequence around the methylated sites nor evidence for clustering of residual methylation in the genome. Our findings indicate random loss rather than specific maintenance of methylation in Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells. Near-complete bisulfite conversion and largely unbiased representation of RRBS libraries suggest that random shotgun bisulfite sequencing can be scaled to a genome-wide approach.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic alterations involved in the control of gene expression. Bisulfite sequencing of genomic DNA is currently the only method to study DNA methylation patterns at single-nucleotide resolution. Hence, next-generation sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA is the method of choice to investigate DNA methylation profiles at the genome-wide scale. Nevertheless, whole genome sequencing for analysis of human methylomes is expensive, and a method for targeted gene analysis would provide a good alternative in many cases where the primary interest is restricted to a set of genes.Here, we report the successful use of a custom Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment system for the hybrid capture of bisulfite-converted DNA. We prepared bisulfite-converted next-generation sequencing libraries, which are enriched for the coding and regulatory regions of 174 ADME genes (i.e. genes involved in the metabolism and distribution of drugs). Sequencing of these libraries on Illumina's HiSeq2000 revealed that the method allows a reliable quantification of methylation levels of CpG sites in the selected genes, and validation of the method using pyrosequencing and the Illumina 450K methylation BeadChips revealed good concordance.},

Changes in methylation patterns are implicated in many diseases, cellular differentiation, imprinting, and other biological processes. Techniques that enrich for biologically relevant genomic regions with high CpG content are desired, since, depending on the size of an organism's methylome, the depth of sequencing required to cover all CpGs can be prohibitively expensive. Currently, restriction enzyme-based reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and its modified protocols are widely used to study methylation differences. Recently, Agilent Technologies, Roche NimbleGen, and Illumina have ventured to both reduce sequencing costs and capture CpGs of known biological relevance by marketing in-solution custom-capture hybridization platforms. We aimed to evaluate the similarities and differences of these four methods considering each platform targets approximately 10–13{\%} of the human methylome.},

Recent improvements to ChIP-seq, such as increased resolution, promise deeper insights into transcriptional regulation, yet require novel computational tools to fully leverage their advantages. RESULTS: To this aim, we have developed peakzilla, which can identify closely spaced TF binding sites at high resolution (i.e. resolves individual binding sites even if spaced closely), as we demonstrate using semisynthetic datasets, performing ChIP-seq for the TF Twist in Drosophila embryos with different experimental fragment sizes, and analyzing ChIP-exo datasets. We show that the increased resolution reached by peakzilla is highly relevant, as closely spaced Twist binding sites are strongly enriched in transcriptional enhancers, suggesting a signature to discriminate functional from abundant non-functional or neutral TF binding. Peakzilla is easy to use, as it estimates all the necessary parameters from the data and is freely available.

abstract = {DNA methylation stabilizes developmentally programmed gene expression states. Aberrant methylation is associated with disease progression and is a common feature of cancer genomes. Presently, few methods enable quantitative, large-scale, single-base resolution mapping of DNA methylation states in desired regions of a complex mammalian genome. Here, we present an approach that combines array-based hybrid selection and massively parallel bisulfite sequencing to profile DNA methylation in genomic regions spanning hundreds of thousands of bases. This single molecule strategy enables methylation variable positions to be quantitatively examined with high sampling precision. Using bisulfite capture, we assessed methylation patterns across 324 randomly selected CpG islands (CGI) representing more than 25,000 CpG sites. A single lane of Illumina sequencing permitted methylation states to be definitively called for {\textgreater}90{\%} of target sties. The accuracy of the hybrid-selection approach was verified using conventional bisulfite capillary sequencing of cloned PCR products amplified from a subset of the selected regions. This confirmed that even partially methylated states could be successfully called. A comparison of human primary and cancer cells revealed multiple differentially methylated regions. More than 25{\%} of islands showed complex methylation patterns either with partial methylation states defining the entire CGI or with contrasting methylation states appearing in specific regional blocks within the island. We observed that transitions in methylation state often correlate with genomic landmarks, including transcriptional start sites and intron-exon junctions. Methylation, along with specific histone marks, was enriched in exonic regions, suggesting that chromatin states can foreshadow the content of mature mRNAs.},

Recent developments in whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology have enabled genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation at single base pair resolution. Many experiments have been conducted to compare DNA methylation profiles under different biological contexts, with the goal of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Due to the high cost of WGBS experiments, many studies are still conducted without biological replicates. Methods and tools available for analyzing such data are very limited.We develop a statistical method, DSS-single, for detecting DMRs from WGBS data without replicates. We characterize the count data using a rigorous model that accounts for the spatial correlation of methylation levels, sequence depth and biological variation. We demonstrate that using information from neighboring CG sites, biological variation can be estimated accurately even without replicates. DMR detection is then carried out via a Wald test procedure. Simulations demonstrate that DSS-single has greater sensitivity and accuracy than existing methods, and an analysis of H1 versus IMR90 cell lines suggests that it also yields the most biologically meaningful results.

abstract = {DNA methylation is essential for normal development and has been implicated in many pathologies including cancer. Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours. More generally, the results establish reduced representation bisulphite sequencing as a powerful technology for epigenetic profiling of cell populations relevant to developmental biology, cancer and regenerative medicine.},

The GENCODE 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding and 9640 long noncoding RNA loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented in UCSC genes and RefSeq. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons.

Over one-third of GENCODE protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas. New models derived from the Illumina Body Map 2.0 RNA-seq data identify 3689 new loci not currently in GENCODE, of which 3127 consist of two exon models indicating that they are possibly unannotated long noncoding loci.

abstract = {Aberrant promoter methylation and associated chromatin changes are primarily studied in human malignancies. Thus far, mouse models for human cancer have been rarely utilized to study the role of DNA methylation in tumor onset and progression. It would be advantageous to use mouse tumor models to a greater extent to study the role and mechanism of DNA methylation in cancer because mouse models allow manipulation of the genome, study of samples/populations with a homogeneous genetic background, the possibility of modulating gene expression in vivo, the statistical power of using large numbers of tumor samples, access to various tumor stages, and the possibility of preclinical trials. Therefore, it is likely that the mouse will emerge as an increasingly utilized model to study DNA methylation in cancer. To foster the use of mouse models, we developed an arrayed mouse NotI–EcoRV genomic library, with clones from three commonly used mouse strains (129SvIMJ, FVB/NJ, and C57BL/6J). A total of 23,040 clones representing an estimated three- to fourfold coverage of the mouse genome were arrayed in 60 × 384-well plates. We developed restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS) mixing gels with 32 plates to enable the cloning of methylated sequences from RLGS profiles run with NotI–EcoRV–HinfI. RLGS was used to study aberrant methylation in two mouse models that overexpressed IL-15 or c-Myc and developed either T/NK-cell leukemia or T-cell lymphomas, respectively. Careful analysis of 198 sequences showed that 188 (94.9{\%}) identified CpG-island sequences, 132 sequences (66.7{\%}) had homology to the 5′ regions of known genes or mRNAs, and all 132 NotI–EcoRV clones were located at the same CpG islands with the predicted promoter sequences. We have also developed a modified pGL3-based luciferase vector that now contains the NotI, AscI, and EcoRV restriction sites and allows the rapid cloning of NotI–EcoRV library fragments in both orientations. Luciferase assays using NotI–EcoRV clones confirmed that the library is enriched for promoter sequences. Thus, this library will support future genetic and epigenetic studies in mouse models.},

Here we describe the 3C procedure in detail, including the appropriate use of the technology, the experimental set-up, an optimized protocol and troubleshooting guide, and considerations for data analysis. The protocol described here contains previously unpublished improvements, which save time and reduce labor. We pay special attention to primer design, appropriate controls and data analysis. We include notes and discussion based on our extensive experience to help researchers understand the principles of 3C-based techniques and to avoid common pitfalls and mistakes.

abstract = {DNA methylation (DNAm)-based biomarkers of aging have been developed for many tissues and organs. However, these biomarkers have sub-optimal accuracy in fibroblasts and other cell types used in ex vivo studies. To address this challenge, we developed a novel and highly robust DNAm age estimator (based on 391 CpGs) for human fibroblasts, keratinocytes, buccal cells, endothelial cells, lymphoblastoid cells, skin, blood, and saliva samples. High age correlations can also be observed in sorted neurons, glia, brain, liver, and even bone samples. Gestational age correlates with DNAm age in cord blood. When used on fibroblasts from Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome patients, this age estimator (referred to as the skin {\&} blood clock) uncovered an epigenetic age acceleration with a magnitude that is below the sensitivity levels of other DNAm-based biomarkers. Furthermore, this highly sensitive age estimator accurately tracked the dynamic aging of cells cultured ex vivo and revealed that their proliferation is accompanied by a steady increase in epigenetic age. The skin {\&} blood clock predicts lifespan and it relates to many age-related conditions. Overall, this biomarker is expected to become useful for forensic applications (e.g. blood or buccal swabs) and for a quantitative ex vivo human cell aging assay.},

The ability to juxtapose annotations of many types facilitates inquiry-driven data mining. Gene predictions, mRNA alignments, epigenomic data from the ENCODE project, conservation scores from vertebrate whole-genome alignments and variation data may be viewed at any scale from a single base to an entire chromosome. The Browser also includes many other widely used tools, including BLAT, which is useful for alignments from high-throughput sequencing experiments. Private data uploaded as Custom Tracks and Data Hubs in many formats may be displayed alongside the rich compendium of precomputed data in the UCSC database. The Table Browser is a full-featured graphical interface, which allows querying, filtering and intersection of data tables. The Saved Session feature allows users to store and share customized views, enhancing the utility of the system for organizing multiple trains of thought. Binary Alignment/Map (BAM), Variant Call Format and the Personal Genome Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) data formats are useful for visualizing a large sequencing experiment (whole-genome or whole-exome), where the differences between the data set and the reference assembly may be displayed graphically.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is not yet known whether DNA methylation levels can be used to accurately predict age across a broad spectrum of human tissues and cell types, nor whether the resulting age prediction is a biologically meaningful measure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: I developed a multi-tissue predictor of age that allows one to estimate the DNA methylation age of most tissues and cell types. The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53 mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: I propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system. This novel epigenetic clock can be used to address a host of questions in developmental biology, cancer and aging research.},

It can successfully detect the effects of certain lifespan-modulating interventions on DNAm age as well as the rejuvenation effect related to the transition from fibroblasts to iPSCs.

Elution of the captured methylated DNA is done in steps using a salt gradient, which stratifies the genome into fractions with different CpG density. The enrichment reached within the individual eluates allows for cost-effective deep sequence coverage. The profiles together yield a detailed genome-wide map of methylated regions and readily allows detection of DNA methylation in known and novel regions.

abstract = {MspJI is a novel modification-dependent restriction endonuclease that cleaves at a fixed distance away from the modification site. Here, we present the biochemical characterization of several MspJI homologs, including FspEI, LpnPI, AspBHI, RlaI, and SgrTI. All of the enzymes specifically recognize cytosine C5 modification (methylation or hydroxymethylation) in DNA and cleave at a constant distance (N12/N16) away from the modified cytosine. Each displays its own sequence context preference, favoring different nucleotides flanking the modified cytosine. By cleaving on both sides of fully modified CpG sites, they allow the extraction of 32-base long fragments around the modified sites from the genomic DNA. These enzymes provide powerful tools for direct interrogation of the epigenome. For example, we show that RlaI, an enzyme that prefers mCWG but not mCpG sites, generates digestion patterns that differ between plant and mammalian genomic DNA, highlighting the difference between their epigenomic patterns. In addition, we demonstrate that deep sequencing of the digested DNA fragments generated from these enzymes provides a feasible method to map the modified sites in the genome. Altogether, the MspJI family of enzymes represent appealing tools of choice for method development in DNA epigenetic studies.},

abstract = {Background: DNA-methylation changes at a discrete set of sites in the human genome are predictive of chronological and biological age. However, it is not known whether these changes are causative or a consequence of an underlying ageing process. It has also not been shown whether this epigenetic clock is unique to humans or conserved in the more experimentally tractable mouse. Results: We have generated a comprehensive set of genome-scale base-resolution methylation maps from multiple mouse tissues spanning a wide range of ages. Many CpG sites show significant tissue-independent correlations with age and allowed us to develop a multi-tissue predictor of age in the mouse. Our model, which estimates age based on DNA methylation at 329 unique CpG sites, has a median absolute error of 3.33 weeks, and has similar properties to the recently described human epigenetic clock. Using publicly available datasets, we find that the mouse clock is accurate enough to measure effects on biological age, including in the context of interventions. While females and males show no significant differences in predicted DNA methylation age, ovariectomy results in significant age acceleration in females. Furthermore, we identify significant differences in age-acceleration dependent on the lipid content of the offspring diet. Conclusions: Here we identify and characterize an epigenetic predictor of age in mice, the mouse epigenetic clock. This clock will be instrumental for understanding the biology of ageing and will allow modulation of its ticking rate and resetting the clock in vivo to study the impact on biological age.},

abstract = {Pediatric developmental syndromes present with systemic, complex, and often overlapping clinical features that are not infrequently a consequence of Mendelian inheritance of mutations in genes involved in DNA methylation, establishment of histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling (the “epigenetic machinery”). The mechanistic cross-talk between histone modification and DNA methylation suggests that these syndromes might be expected to display specific DNA methylation signatures that are a reflection of those primary errors associated with chromatin dysregulation. Given the interrelated functions of these chromatin regulatory proteins, we sought to identify DNA methylation epi-signatures that could provide syndrome-specific biomarkers to complement standard clinical diagnostics. In the present study, we examined peripheral blood samples from a large cohort of individuals encompassing 14 Mendelian disorders displaying mutations in the genes encoding proteins of the epigenetic machinery. We demonstrated that specific but partially overlapping DNA methylation signatures are associated with many of these conditions. The degree of overlap among these epi-signatures is minimal, further suggesting that, consistent with the initial event, the downstream changes are unique to every syndrome. In addition, by combining these epi-signatures, we have demonstrated that a machine learning tool can be built to concurrently screen for multiple syndromes with high sensitivity and specificity, and we highlight the utility of this tool in solving ambiguous case subjects presenting with variants of unknown significance, along with its ability to generate accurate predictions for subjects presenting with the overlapping clinical and molecular features associated with the disruption of the epigenetic machinery.},

abstract = {We present a systematic assessment of RainDrop BS-seq, a novel method for large-scale, targeted bisulfite sequencing using microdroplet-based PCR amplification coupled with next-generation sequencing. We compared DNA methylation levels at 498 target loci (1001 PCR amplicons) in human whole blood, osteosarcoma cells and an archived tumor tissue sample. We assessed the ability of RainDrop BS-seq to accurately measure DNA methylation over a range of DNA quantities (from 10 to 1500 ng), both with and without whole-genome amplification (WGA) following bisulfite conversion. DNA methylation profiles generated using at least 100 ng correlated well (median R = 0.92) with those generated on Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips, currently the platform of choice for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). WGA allowed for testing of samples with a starting DNA amount of 10 and 50 ng, although a reduced correlation was observed (median R = 0.79). We conclude that RainDrop BS-seq is suitable for measuring DNA methylation levels using nanogram quantities of DNA, and can be used to study candidate epigenetic biomarker loci in an accurate and high-throughput manner, paving the way for its application to routine clinical diagnostics.},

This parameter is crucial to the expectation, that either all fragments made by restriction will be suitable for the method of choice, or only a fraction of those will be effectively used by the method. If only a fraction of the fragments are used, we often should know whether the used fragments are representative of the whole genome.

This has resulted in an exponential increase of 450k data in recent years and triggered the development of numerous integrated analysis pipelines and stand-alone packages. This review will introduce and discuss the currently most popular pipelines and packages and is particularly aimed at new 450k users.},

abstract = {Illumina's HumanMethylation450 arrays provide the most cost-effective means of high-throughput DNA methylation analysis. As with other types of microarray platforms, technical artifacts are a concern, including background fluorescence, dye-bias from the use of two color channels, bias caused by type I/II probe design, and batch effects. Several approaches and pipelines have been developed, either targeting a single issue or designed to address multiple biases through a combination of methods. We evaluate the effect of combining separate approaches to improve signal processing.},

abstract = {The 27k Illumina Infinium Methylation Beadchip is a popular high-throughput technology that allows the methylation state of over 27,000 CpGs to be assayed. While feature selection and classification methods have been comprehensively explored in the context of gene expression data, relatively little is known as to how best to perform feature selection or classification in the context of Illumina Infinium methylation data. Given the rising importance of epigenomics in cancer and other complex genetic diseases, and in view of the upcoming epigenome wide association studies, it is critical to identify the statistical methods that offer improved inference in this novel context.},

@article{Touleimat2012,
abstract = {Background: Huge progress has been made in the development of array- or sequencing-based technologies for DNA methylation analysis. The Illumina Infinium? Human Methylation 450K BeadChip (Illumina Inc., CA, USA) allows the simultaneous quantitative monitoring of more than 480,000 CpG positions, enabling large-scale epigenotyping studies. However, the assay combines two different assay chemistries, which may cause a bias in the analysis if all signals are merged as a unique source of methylation measurement. Materials {\&} methods: We confirm in three 450K data sets that Infinium I signals are more stable and cover a wider dynamic range of methylation values than Infinium II signals. We evaluated the methylation profile of Infinium I and II probes obtained with different normalization protocols and compared these results with the methylation values of a subset of CpGs analyzed by pyrosequencing. Results: We developed a subset quantile normalization approach for the processing of 450K BeadChips. The Infinium I signals were used as ?anchors? to normalize Infinium II signals at the level of probe coverage categories. Our normalization approach outperformed alternative normalization or correction approaches in terms of bias correction and methylation signal estimation. We further implemented a complete preprocessing protocol that solves most of the issues currently raised by 450K array users. Conclusion: We developed a complete preprocessing pipeline for 450K BeadChip data using an original subset quantile normalization approach that performs both sample normalization and efficient Infinium I/II shift correction. The scripts, being freely available from the authors, will allow researchers to concentrate on the biological analysis of data, such as the identification of DNA methylation signatures.},
