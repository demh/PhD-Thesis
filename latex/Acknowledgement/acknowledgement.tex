This thesis has made use of a great amount of chronological time (hopefully not too much biological time) of a lot of people. This is also their work. I am deeply thankful ...

\smallskip

... to Janet Thornton, for opening the doors of the EBI to me, showing me the true nature of critical thinking, science and proper discussion, and for supporting my (sometimes) wild ideas and plans;  

... to Wolf Reik, who is responsible for my scientific crush on epigenetics, for accepting me as an unofficial student, providing always stimulating ideas and inviting me to his garden parties;

... to Tom Stubbs, for his scientific creativity, friendship and burrito evenings;

... to the rest of my collaborators, especially Marc Jan Bonder, Antonio Ribeiro and Erfan Aref-Eshghi, for their contributions;

... to the rest of my TAC members, Oliver Stegle, Judith Zaugg and Gos Micklem, for their guidance;

... to Nils Eling, Hannah Meyer, Jack Monahan and Max Stammnitz; for taking the time to read through these pages and send me their thoughts and comments;

... to the incredible people in the Thornton and Reik labs, for their input and many shared lunches (and some beers);

... a mi familia, por su amor y apoyo siempre incondicional (y por alimentarme tan bien);

... a Parvathi `Ale' Subbiah, porque su `efecto' me ha dado fuerza todos los días desde que la conocí (y por ayudarme con el diseño de las figuras);

... to the EMBL-EBI crowd, especially to Jack, Nils, Lara, Omar, Hannah and Julia, for many nights at the Blue Moon;

... to the rest of the Cambridge crowd, including members of Los del Cam (Max, Vlad, Gogi, Ale), Churchill College (Barbora, basketball team), the CompBio MPhil (Daniel, Elias, Dalia, Andy) and becari@s La Caixa; for keeping me sane in this bubble;

... a mis amigos de Salamanca (Salón del Té) y de Soria (Club de Bebedores Mercadona); por su eterna amistad;

... to La Caixa and EMBL, for funding me and giving me the opportunity to be writing these words.

... to all those people that I forgot to include because of my procrastination, they know who they are.
